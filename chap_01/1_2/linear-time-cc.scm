;; (time (estimation (expt 10 10))) ; $100 million, takes 240 sec = 4 min
;; (time (estimation (expt 10 11))) ;   $1 billion, takes 2 hours


;; Order of growth hypothesis
;; --------------------------

;;  Time complexity: O(n)
;; Space complexity: O(n⁴)

;; In reality, duration of the program steps increases with big numbers.
;; This can be seen already with calculating ways of change to $1 billion.
;; What should have taken 40 min according to O(n) growth, took 2 hours.

;; What comes to space, the O(n⁴) growth follows from the summand formula.
;; It's highest power is n², but the formula is used a number of times
;; that is proportional to n. This raises the highest power to n³.

;; The number of partial sums when k is even, is also proportional to n,
;; so the calculating formula is in effect 4th degree polynome. Thus O(n⁴).

;; Experimental observation confirms this: whenever input grows 10 times,
;; output grows asymptotically 10⁴ times. It is easily tested like this:

;; (define amount (expt 10 8))
;; (/ (count-change (* 10 amount)) (count-change amount) 1.0)
;; => 9999.982900020708

;; (set! amount (expt 10 9))
;; (/ (count-change (* 10 amount)) (count-change amount) 1.0)
;; => 9999.998290000209

;; The same space complexity O(n⁴) also characterizes the original algorithm
;; in the book. Not O(n) inferred from tree depth. O(n) is valid only when
;; using floating-point numbers instead of bignums.


;; Sketch of the formula derivation
;; --------------------------------

;; The formula cc(n, 3) = ⌊n/10⌋⌊n/5⌋ - ⌊n/10⌋² + ⌊n/5⌋ + 1 is derived
;; step-by-step by observing the process tree. Thanks to regular patterns
;; and redundancies in the tree, most of the branches can be cut down.

;; We start the mutilation in the left periphery by observing that
;; cc(n, 1) = 1 regardless of n. That is obvious because there is only one
;; way to make change to any amount using one kind of coin. The whole
;; subtree with root node cc(n, 1) can therefore be replaced with 1.

;; Going up, we notice that cc(n, 2) branches to cc(n, 1), which is just 1,
;; and to cc(n - 5, 2). The branching continues with the same pattern
;; until there is nothing more to subtract from n. There are exactly ⌊n/5⌋
;; nodes cc(n - k·5, 2) down-right from cc(n, 2), (k = 1..⌊n/5⌋).

;; Every such node has cc(n - k·5, 1) as a child node, which is 1.
;; So cc(n, 2) is the sum of all those ones. ⌊n/5⌋ ones come from the right
;; sub-branch, and single 1 comes from the left sub-branch, giving ⌊n/5⌋ + 1
;; as the value of cc(n, 2).

;; Finding cc(n, 3) is slightly more complicated. We need to sum the terms
;; ⌊(n - k·10)/5⌋ + 1, where k = 0..⌊n/10⌋. After regrouping and simplifying,
;; and using the well-known formula for the sum of arithmetic series,
;; we arrive at cc(n, 3) = ⌊n/10⌋⌊n/5⌋ - ⌊n/10⌋² + ⌊n/5⌋ + 1.
